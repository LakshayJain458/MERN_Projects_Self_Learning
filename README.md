# MERN Projects Repository

Welcome to my MERN Projects Repository! This repository is dedicated to showcasing my journey and projects built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). I'll be continuously adding new projects as I develop them, each with its own unique features and functionalities.

## Current Projects

### 1. Password Manager
The Password Manager is the first project in this repository. It allows users to securely store and manage their passwords. The project supports two storage options:
- **MongoDB**: For centralized, scalable storage.
- **Local Storage**: For quick, client-side storage.

Features:
- Secure password encryption
- User authentication and authorization
- Add, update, and delete passwords
- Support for both MongoDB and local storage

## Future Projects

Stay tuned! I plan to add more exciting projects to this repository as I continue exploring and building with the MERN stack.
